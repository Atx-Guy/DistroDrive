Phase 3: The 'ISO Archive' Section (UI)

Below the main 'Download Latest' button, create a new section titled 'Previous Versions'.

Render a compact list or table of the 2nd and 3rd most recent releases.

Include their Version Number, Release Date, and a smaller 'Download ISO' button for each.

Execution: Please update the schema if necessary (it should be fine), modify the server-side data fetching logic, and render these new components on the Distro Detail page."

Decided on Distro Detail page upgrade
I'll implement the "Time Machine" feature for the Distro Detail page. Let me start by understanding the current structure and then build the feature.

Searched DistributionDetail page functionality

Opened client/src/pages/DistributionDetail.tsx

Decided on chart and archive sections (4 seconds)
I can see the page already fetches all releases. Let me delegate the full implementation to a subagent.

Implementing distribution detail page

Requested architect review of changes
The implementation is complete. Let me have the architect review it.

Reviewed Time Machine feature implementation

Decided on release data validation
The architect found issues. Let me fix them.

Reviewing Agent's code

Reviewed architect's confirmation
Fix applied. Let me verify with the architect and run a test.

Verified Time Machine feature fix

Planned feature verification and closure
The architect approved. Let me run a test to verify the feature works.

Great news! The page for Ubuntu and its distribution details is working just as it should. You can see the Ubuntu name, the release history chart with its legend, and the previous versions with their download buttons all appear correctly. The system also successfully fetched the Ubuntu release information. Just a heads-up, the testing didn't check if the actual downloaded files are correct, nor did it look into the specific details of the chart's data points or how it might look on different browsers.

Restarted Start application

Decided on next steps
The test passed. Let me update the task list and wrap up.

Completed tasks

Decided on feature completion notification
The "Time Machine" feature is complete! Here's what was added to the Distribution Detail pages:

Release History Chart

Visual timeline showing all releases as a scatter chart
X-axis shows release dates, Y-axis shows version numbers
Color-coded: green dots for LTS releases, blue for standard releases
Interactive tooltips showing details when you hover over each release
Discontinuation Warning

If a distribution's last release was more than 2 years ago, a prominent red warning badge appears: "Warning: Potentially Discontinued"
Previous Versions Archive

Shows the 2nd and 3rd most recent releases below the main release table
Displays version number, LTS badge if applicable, release date, and file size
Download buttons for each available architecture
You can test it by visiting any distribution detail page (like /distro/1 for Ubuntu).

Would you like me to publish the app so you can share it with others?
