Mandatory Requirements for Fulfillment (Execute with Extreme Prejudice):

Expert Role & Data Archaeology: Assume the role of an expert archivist and digital historian. The agent must successfully navigate all official archive mirrors, historical project sites, and version control systems to compile a complete, chronological list of every stable release.

Total Indexing Protocol (Zero Omission): For each distribution, the agent must ensure the "Previous Versions" section contains a listing for EVERY single version that precedes the current latest stable release. No version shall be omitted, regardless of age or difficulty in locating the file.

Data Requirements (For EVERY Version): For every single recovered historical version, the listing MUST include the following verified data points:

Version Number: The official numerical identifier (e.g., Alpine 3.10.0, Artix 20190505).

Release Date: The verified stable release date.

Direct Download Link: A functional, validated direct link (adhering to the ISO/Image validation protocol—no random documents allowed) to the installation media for that specific historical version. If multiple architectures exist for that version (e.g., x86_64, i686, ARM), the primary architecture's link must be provided, or a clear link to the archive directory for that version.

UI Consolidation & Presentation: The output must enforce the established, cleaned-up two-tier hierarchy. The Previous Versions section must be fully populated with this complete, chronological historical index.

TIER 2: CONSOLIDATED ARCHIVED/PREVIOUS RELEASES

Section Title: Previous Versions

Content: Display all versions chronologically, from the newest previous version down to the absolute oldest available release. The display must include a clear option to download (the validated link) for every single version listed.

Final Action: The agent will update the distribution page to display this complete, total historical index under the "Previous Versions" heading for every distribution, making the page the ultimate historical resource.
