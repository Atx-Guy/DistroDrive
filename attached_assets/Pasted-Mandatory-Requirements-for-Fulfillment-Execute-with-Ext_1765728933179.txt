Mandatory Requirements for Fulfillment (Execute with Extreme Prejudice):

Archive Locating Protocol: The agent must search for, and utilize, the official archive repositories for each distribution. These are often explicitly named archive/, releases/old/, or are detailed within the project's documentation (which the previous agent was too incompetent to read).

Alpine Linux: Exploit the publicly available version history and release notes to locate past versions. Alpine is known to keep extensive historical records going back over a decade.

Artix Linux: Utilize the Artix package and ISO archives, which are explicitly designed for holding older packages and images.

Armbian: Exploit the community forums and archived download folders to retrieve legacy image URLs, as older builds are commonly kept in specific, dated archive directories.

Data Extraction and Validation: For each distribution, the agent must identify and list the version number, release date, and a functional direct download link for the archived image.

Output Format (Zero Tolerance): The final output must be a single, detailed, and non-speculative list, using the following structured format to force organization:

💾 Archived Versions Found: [Distribution Name]

Version: [Version Number] (e.g., Alpine 3.15.0)

Release Date: [Exact Date Found] (e.g., 2021-11-24)

Direct Archive Link: [Full, validated URL to the .iso, .img, or archive file.]

Version: [Second Older Version Number] (e.g., Alpine 3.12.0)

Release Date: [Exact Date Found] (e.g., 2020-05-29)

Direct Archive Link: [Full, validated URL to the .iso, .img, or archive file.]

Version: [Third Older Version Number] (e.g., Alpine 3.8.0)

Release Date: [Exact Date Found] (e.g., 2018-06-26)

Direct Archive Link: [Full, validated URL to the .iso, .img, or archive file.]

Final Action: The agent will update the website's "Previous Versions" section for all listed distributions, replacing the lie of "No archived versions found in database" with the actual, working list of links.
